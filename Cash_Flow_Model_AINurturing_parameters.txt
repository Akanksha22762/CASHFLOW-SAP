AI-Specific Input Features
Modeling Considerations
Time granularity (daily, weekly, monthly) based on operational needs.
Forecast horizon: 3, 6, 12, or 18 months depending on business cycles.
Incorporation of confidence intervals for each forecast line.
Real-time adjustments based on new inflow/outflow events.
Scenario planning (best, worst, most likely).
AI Features to Include
Time series forecasting using models like ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet.
Anomaly detection to spot unexpected large inflows/outflows.
Clustering for customer payment behavior profiling.
Reinforcement learning for scenario optimization.
AutoML pipelines to identify best predictors (correlations).
Output Metrics to Monitor
Projected cash inflows/outflows (by type and time)
Net cash flow
Opening and closing cash balance
Burn rate (for startups)
Runway (months until cash out)
Liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio)
Advanced Components for High-Accuracy Predictive & Prescriptive Modeling
1. Enhanced Data Inputs
2. Behavioral and Pattern Recognition
3. AI/ML Model Enhancements
4. External Signal Integration
5. Prescriptive Capabilities
6. Feedback Loops & Accuracy Monitoring
Backtesting & model drift detection: Ensure model remains relevant over time
Real-time accuracy scoring: Compare forecasted vs. actual daily/weekly/monthly cash flow
User feedback incorporation: Incorporate finance team adjustments into learning model
Anomaly training data: Label and use prior crisis/outlier periods (e.g., COVID) for robustness
7. UX/Workflow Integration for Actionability
Dashboard with drilldowns: View per customer, region, product cash flow contribution
Alerts and nudges: Flag low cash runway, missed collection dates, breach of covenants
Collaboration hooks: Notify procurement, HR, or sales when forecasts trigger thresholds
Cash Optimization Engine: Prescribe how to reallocate funds across departments/projects

# Console Output Debug Guide

## Problem
You're not able to see what's happening in the command prompt when clicking buttons in the web interface.

## Solution
I've created several files to help you see console output immediately:

### Option 1: Use the Enhanced Runner (Recommended)
```bash
# Run this instead of python app1.py
python run_app_with_debug.py
```

### Option 2: Use the Batch File (Windows)
```bash
# Double-click or run in command prompt
run_app.bat
```

### Option 3: Use the PowerShell Script (Windows)
```powershell
# Run in PowerShell
.\run_app.ps1
```

### Option 4: Manual Setup
If you want to run the original file, set these environment variables first:
```bash
set PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
set FLASK_ENV=development
set FLASK_DEBUG=1
python app1.py
```

## Test Console Output
Once the server is running, you can test if console output is working:

1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000/test-console`
2. You should see output in your command prompt immediately
3. The output should show:
   ```
   üîç TEST CONSOLE OUTPUT ROUTE CALLED!
   üìù This should appear in your command prompt immediately
   ‚è∞ Timestamp: [current time]
      Processing step 1/5...
      Processing step 2/5...
      ...
   ‚úÖ Console output test completed!
   ```

## What You Should See
When you click buttons in the web interface, you should now see:
- Real-time processing messages
- AI categorization progress
- File upload status
- Error messages (if any)
- Performance metrics

## Troubleshooting
If you still don't see output:

1. **Check if the server is running**: You should see startup messages
2. **Test the console route**: Visit `http://localhost:5000/test-console`
3. **Check the log file**: Look at `cashflow_app.log` for detailed logs
4. **Try different terminal**: Use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt

## Files Created
- `run_app_with_debug.py` - Enhanced Flask runner with better console output
- `run_app.bat` - Windows batch file
- `run_app.ps1` - PowerShell script
- `test_console_output.py` - Standalone test script
- `CONSOLE_OUTPUT_DEBUG.md` - This guide

## Quick Test
Run this to test console output:
```bash
python test_console_output.py
```

You should see animated progress indicators and immediate output.
